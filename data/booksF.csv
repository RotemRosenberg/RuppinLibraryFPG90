2,"A History of the U.S. Army Officer Corps, 1900-1990",,2,,,Department of the Army,2014,"The present volume was written as a supplement to a series of monographs authored by Casey Wardynski, David Lyle, and Mike Colarusso of the Army's Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis, and published by the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College from 2009 to 2010. In those monographs, Wardynski, Lyle, and Colarusso adumbrated an officer corps strategy based on the theory of talent management. This volume aims to provide a historical context for their discussion of an officer strategy (and for what has passed for such a strategy in the past). Like the earlier monographs, this volume is organized around the functionally interdependent concepts of accessing, developing, retaining, and employing talent. Each chapter will take the reader up to the point where the earlier monographs began their story, which generally falls in the timeframe of the late-1980s and early-1990s. The purpose of the present volume is to supplement these OEMA (Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis) monographs by providing a historical context for their discussion of an officer strategy. First an overview is provided, outlining some key developments and assumptions that have guided and shaped the Officer Corps and the way it has been managed over the last century.

6,The Unworthy,A Novel,5,,,Simon and Schuster,1905,"The long-awaited new novel from the author of global sensation Tender Is the Flesh: a thrilling work of literary horror about a woman cloistered in a secretive, violent religious order, while outside the world has fallen into chaos. From her cell in a mysterious convent, a woman writes the story of her life in whatever she can find—discarded ink, dirt, and even her own blood. A lower member of the Sacred Sisterhood, deemed an unworthy, she dreams of ascending to the ranks of the Enlightened at the center of the convent and of pleasing the foreboding Superior Sister. Outside, the world is plagued by catastrophe—cities are submerged underwater, electricity and the internet are nonexistent, and bands of survivors fight and forage in a cruel, barren landscape. Inside, the narrator is controlled, punished, but safe. But when a stranger makes her way past the convent walls, joining the ranks of the unworthy, she forces the narrator to consider her long-buried past—and what she may be overlooking about the Enlightened. As the two women grow closer, the narrator is increasingly haunted by questions about her own past, the environmental future, and her present life inside the convent. How did she get to the Sacred Sisterhood? Why can’t she remember her life before? And what really happens when a woman is chosen as one of the Enlightened? A searing, dystopian tale about climate crisis, ideological extremism, and the tidal pull of our most violent, exploitative instincts, this is another unforgettable novel from a master of feminist horror.",0,Fiction,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oEgMEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oEgMEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=oEgMEQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=oEgMEQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Unworthy.html?hl=&id=oEgMEQAAQBAJ,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oEgMEQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,32

He’s hungry to contribute something that matters, while all around him his peers are squandering their political and financial power, coasting through life. Which is exactly why he can’t stand the new Viscount Demeroven. …insufferable… James Demeroven, just come of age and into the Viscountcy, knows that he’s a disappointment. Keeping his head down and never raising anyone’s expectations is how he’s survived life with his stepfather.

But Mason is also brash and recklessly unapologetic, destined to shatter the fragile safety of James’s world. Worst of all, he keeps rubbing James’s failures in his face. …hottest man to ever walk the ton.” They can barely get through a single conversation without tensions boiling over. Neither Bobby nor James has ever met a more intriguing, infuriating, infatuating man. If only they could avoid each other entirely. Bad enough their (wonderful but determined) cousins Beth and Gwen keep conveniently setting up group outings.

But her love of and affinity for languages enables her to create a new life—to separate herself from her toxic environment and to build a successful, decades-long career as a professional multilinguist. It’s a rewarding vocation, but a challenging one: her assignments with the US federal government take her on some hair-raisingly dangerous journeys, some to countries with unstable governments and even active war zones. But these sometimes-harrowing experiences teach her how to open the “windows” around her, unearth her true self, and develop a healthy sense of self-worth—and ultimately, paradoxically, her work and travel so far from home allow her to come home to herself.",178,Family & Relationships,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1CYGEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1CYGEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=1CYGEQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Travel&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=1CYGEQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Travel&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Immersion.html?hl=&id=1CYGEQAAQBAJ,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1CYGEQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,50

20,A Sea Full of Turtles,The Search for Optimism in an Epoch of Extinction,19,,,Simon and Schuster,2024,"An inspired and impassioned story of adventure that explores the richness of marine life and charts a path of resilience and hope. Everyone alive today is witnessing a mass extinction event caused by the more than eight billion humans who share this planet. At times, it seems there is little hope. Climate change, resource exploitation, agrochemicals, overfishing, plastics, dead zones in our oceans, drought and desertification, conversion of habitat to housing, farming, and industrial infrastructure—the list of impacts and insults goes on and on. We are, it seems, on an unalterable path that will continue to decimate biodiversity. A feeling of hopeless, while not unwarranted, is part of the problem. Without hope, without some belief in the possibility of positive outcomes, the fight for nature is over. Why even try if the battle is already lost? While staring the problems squarely in the face, A Sea Full of Turtles offers hope for those who care about our living world. Delivered as a travel narrative set in Mexico’s Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez), at one level the book focuses on dramatically underfunded but highly successful efforts to protect sea turtles. But the book goes beyond Mexico and beyond sea turtles to look at how some humans have changed their relationship with nature—and how that change can one day end the extinction crisis. Enchanting, galvanizing, and brimming with joy and wonder, A Sea Full of Turtles will inspire immediate action to face the great challenges that lie ahead. Pessimism is the lazy way out. Optimism, it turns out, is both a reasonable and an essential attitude for us all as we fight for the beautiful diversity of life on our Earth.",200,Nature,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DxndEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DxndEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=DxndEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Travel&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DxndEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DxndEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DxndEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,27

Indian art, religions, technology, astronomy, music, dance, literature, mathematics and mythology blazed a trail across the world, along a Golden Road that stretched from the Red Sea to the Pacific. William Dalrymple draws from a lifetime of scholarship to highlight India's oft-forgotten position as the heart of ancient Eurasia. For the first time, he gives a name to this spread of Indian ideas that transformed the world. From the largest Hindu temple in the world at Angkor Wat to the Buddhism of China, from the trade that helped fund the Roman Empire to the creation of the numerals we use today (including zero), India transformed the culture and technology of its ancient world – and our world today as we know it.

22,RAPilates: Body and Mind Conditioning in the Digital Age,,21,104,,Akashic Books,2024,"Hip-hop icon Chuck D presents a gorgeously illustrated Pilates exercise program for people of all ages, including the over-forty crowd LEGENDARY HIP-HOP ARTIST CHUCK D has been touring the world for four decades, since his band Public Enemy put out their first album in 1987. Now, at age sixty-three, Chuck is frequently asked how he still manages to put on such high-energy performances so many years later. His response is simple: he practices Pilates, a form of exercise and body conditioning that has become increasingly popular over the last decade. Chuck’s appreciation for Pilates took a major leap in 2016 when he was setting out on a rigorous tour schedule with a powerful and energetic new band called Prophets of Rage (a supergroup including members of Public Enemy and Rage Against the Machine). Over the next four years, the group would perform to more than two million people across the globe. As Chuck admits, he simply could not have delivered on such a massive level without his practice of Pilates. In this volume, Chuck and his Pilates guru, Kathy Lopez, present the “RAPilates” program of more than thirty mat-based exercises for people of all ages and experiences. The exercises are beautifully illustrated in the inimitable style that Chuck has demonstrated in his previous books of visual art, including STEWdio and Summer of Hamn. Like those two books, RAPilates is published on Chuck’s Enemy Books imprint, which is hosted by Akashic Books.",107,Health & Fitness,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JqoKEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JqoKEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=JqoKEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Art&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=JqoKEQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Art&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/RAPilates_Body_and_Mind_Conditioning_in.html?hl=&id=JqoKEQAAQBAJ,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JqoKEQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,36
23,Dancing on My Own,"Essays on Art, Collectivity, and Joy",22,,,HarperCollins,2024,"A The Millions and Hyperallergic Most Anticipated Book of 2024 | A Publishers Weekly Summer Reads Pick “Simon Wu manages to be both a shrewd critic and enthused aspirant of what passes for today’s cultural capital. . . . with a disarming lack of cynicism that is both keen and refreshing.” –Cathy Park Hong ""A genius melding of art criticism, autobiography, personal essay, and travel writing. . . . Wu—an artist, curator, and writer—layers experiences like translucent curtains through which we see the landscape of a past in the present making its future."" –Claudia Rankine An expansive and deeply personal essay collection which explores the aesthetics of class aspiration, the complications of creating art and fashion, and the limits of identity politics. In Robyn’s 2010 track Dancing on My Own, the Swedish pop-singer chronicles a night on the dance floor in the shadow of a former lover. She is bitter, angry, and at times desperate, and yet by the time the chorus arrives her frustration has melted away. She decides to dance on her own, and in this way, she transforms her solitude into a more complex joy. Taking inspiration from Robyn’s seminal track, emerging art critic and curator Simon Wu dances through the institutions of art, capitalism, and identity in these expertly researched, beautifully rendered essays. In “A Model Childhood” he catalogs the decades’ worth of clutter in his mother’s suburban garage and its meaning for himself and his family. In “For Everyone,” Wu explores the complicated sensation of the Telfar bag (often referred to as “the Brooklyn Birkin”) and asks whether fashion can truly be revolutionary in a capitalist system—if something can truly be “for everyone” without undercutting someone else. Throughout, Wu centers the sticky vulnerability of living in a body in a world where history is mapped into every choice we make, every party drug we take, and every person we kiss. Wu’s message is that to dance on your own is to move from critique into joy. To approach identity with the utmost sympathy for the kinds of belonging it might promise, and to look beyond it. For readers of Cathy Park Hong and Alexander Chee, Dancing on My Own is a deeply felt and ultimately triumphant anthem about the never-ending journey of discovering oneself, and introduces a brilliant new writer on the rise.",227,Literary Collections,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oRXZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oRXZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=oRXZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Art&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oRXZEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oRXZEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oRXZEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,39

26,Invisible Loss,Recognizing and Healing the Unacknowledged Heartbreak of Everyday Grief,25,,,Sounds True,2024,"From an acclaimed grief educator and the author of Second Firsts and Where Did You Go? comes a road map to recognize and heal the unspoken, often misunderstood experience of everyday loss, so you can finally reenter and live your life in full. “Compared to most, my problems are small. I should be happy with what I’ve got.” Our inner judge often tells us grief is “allowed” for big losses, but that we should tough out everyday heartbreak. The loss of a loved one and a devastating divorce are likely to be accepted as grief events. But what about moments when we feel overlooked, disregarded, or misunderstood? This could look like rejection in the workplace, lack of intimacy in a relationship, being overlooked by friends, or working in a position that’s not a dream job. “These are losses society doesn’t recognize, mirror back to us, or validate,” says acclaimed grief educator Christina Rasmussen. “As a result, we don’t recognize or validate them either.” This unacknowledged type of grief—invisible losses that are often labeled as not worthy of recognition—can be hard to define and may surface as feelings of anxiety, depression, angst, or restlessness. These are the moments when we shift perception of ourselves and can end up living in continuous survival mode, without really recognizing or understanding why. In Invisible Loss, Rasmussen shines a light on this unrecognized form of grief. Because we avoid invisible loss, we don’t process it; instead, we seek the protection of an endless “waiting room” in the hope that time will heal our wounds. Here, Rasmussen helps you meet your loss, free from shame or guilt, to explore: • The origin of your invisible loss and how you’ve coped along the way • The five life reentry phases based on the Life Reentry® Model • Exercises to help you find your way out of the waiting room • Guidance in reframing your thoughts toward your original self “The entire world is silently grieving, attempting to process a form of heartbreak unlike anything we’ve ever experienced. We need a new language and road map for our invisible losses,” says Rasmussen. This guide gives you the tools you need in order to heal, move forward, and embrace the life you were meant to lead.",251,Psychology,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mFWzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mFWzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=mFWzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychology&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mFWzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mFWzEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mFWzEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,24
27,Why Are People Into That?,A Cultural Investigation of Kink,26,,,Hachette UK,2024,"From a #1 Apple podcast host, Lambda Literary fellow, and dominatrix comes a sex-positive, judgment-free cultural deep-dive into the world of kink. When celebrated BDSM educator Tina Horn first launched Why Are People Into That?!, publications from Vice to Buzzfeed heralded it as one of the best sex podcasts around. Each episode centered around a different fetish or fantasy, thoughtfully examining why, exactly, different strokes work for different folks. From sex workers and scientists to artists and activists, Tina’s wide range of guests helped educate fascinated listeners across the world on the wide spectrum of humanity’s appetites. With her listeners growing more and more insatiable, she soon realized that the only way to address the titular question with all the depth and nuance it deserved was to turn that idea into a book. From spanking, strap-ons, and sluts, to taboos involving cake, chains, and cannibalism, WHY ARE PEOPLE INTO THAT? explores the universal drives that shape even the most specific erotic tastes, and the cultural context that molds and is molded by the way we conceptualize pleasure, gender, fantasy, and power. With buoyant prose, Tina invites us to reconsider everything we thought we knew about sexuality. How, for example, should we think about ""consensual nonconsent"" in a post-#MeToo era? How does cross-dressing fit in with our evolving cultural understanding of gender performance and identity? And what do foot fetishists, fisters, and FinDoms have in common? Blending insightful cultural criticism, investigative journalism, and spicy anecdotes from Tina’s 15+ years of hard-earned expertise in the sex industry and beyond, WHY ARE PEOPLE INTO THAT? is a philosophical-but-fun exploration of the prismatic spectrum of human desire and the expansive possibilities of pleasure. For fans of adrienne maree brown and Emily Nagoski, this raunchy and rousing book is perfect for anyone who is interested not only in the intricacies of what we desire, but in how desire itself really works.",253,Social Science,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vz3dEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vz3dEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=Vz3dEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychology&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vz3dEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vz3dEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Vz3dEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,25

31,Enemy of the Sun,Poetry of Palestinian Resistance,30,106,,Seven Stories Press,2025,"A collection of Palestinian poetry originally published in 1970 that resonates with liberation and civil rights struggles around the world. This updated edition for the current generation of activists features new poems translated by Edmund Ghareeb, an internationally recognized Lebanese-American scholar, and a new foreword by Dr. Greg Thomas. In 1971, in the wake of George Jackson’s killing by San Quentin prison guards, a poem entitled “Enemy of the Sun” was found among ninety-nine books in the revolutionary’s cell. The handwritten poem came to be circulated in Black Panther newspapers under Jackson’s name, assumed to be a vestige of his more than a decade long incarceration. But Jackson never wrote the poem; it was authored by the Palestinian poet Sameeh Al-Qassem and had been included in an anthology of the same title a year before Jackson’s death. Originally published by Drum & Spear, the publishing arm of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Enemy of the Sun: Poetry of Palestinian Resistance links twelve poets working in a poetics of refusal and of hope. Bearing witness to decades of Zionist occupation, to a diaspora exiled in refugee camps and writers held captive in Israeli jails, the collection offers a means to an end: “as poetry, yes it sings—as bullets on a mission; it calls for change.” In each poem is a whole life—joy, love, beauty, rage, sorrow, suffering—and in each life is a record of resistance: the traces of a people who refuse to leave their homeland, who time and again alchemize grief into principled struggle. In the intertwined histories of this book, and in the unyielding political edge of the poems themselves, is a long story of solidarity between oppressed peoples: from Palestine to South Africa to Algeria to Vietnam to the United States.",0,Poetry,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6BEJEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6BEJEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=6BEJEQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Poetry&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=6BEJEQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Enemy_of_the_Sun.html?hl=&id=6BEJEQAAQBAJ,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6BEJEQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,22

36,Taste in Music,Eating on Tour with Indie Musicians,35,107,,Chronicle Books,2024,"In this unique and deeply thoughtful collection, musician Alex Bleeker (Real Estate) and food and travel journalist Luke Pyenson (formerly of Frankie Cosmos) take readers on tour with a diverse lineup of inspiring indie musicians from around the world, sharing meals and travel experiences, peeking behind the curtain at this singular and singularly misunderstood way of life. Through original essays and engaging conversations with dozens of indie musicians representing several subgenres, scenes, and eras, food takes center stage in stories about being on tour and eating on tour and how this basic human necessity can create a sense of community and interconnectedness in one of the most mobile industries in the world. Based broadly on the subject of eating on tour, these entries each spin off into their own focused and exciting behind-the-scenes story, but all confirm what Pyenson and Bleeker suspected all along—food looms large in the lives of touring musicians, and it can be used as a gateway into understanding what going on tour is really like. Featured contributors include: Robin Pecknold (Fleet Foxes) Chris Frantz (Talking Heads) Natalie Mering (Weyes Blood) Mark Ibold (Pavement) John Gourley (Portugal. The Man) Lily Chait (touring chef to boygenius and Phoebe Bridgers) Amelia Meath (Sylvan Esso) Greta Kline (Frankie Cosmos) Devendra Banhart Bob Mould (Hüsker Dü) Brian ""Geologist"" Weitz (Animal Collective) Dawn Richard Sasami Ashworth (SASAMI) Sadie Dupuis (Speedy Ortiz) The Beths In addition to wide-angle meditations about eating on tour, Pyenson and Bleeker have gathered stories that take place on five continents, in private homes and street-side stalls, in temples of fine dining and in actual temples, backstage and in the van, early morning and late at night. Stories that deal with the best parts of touring: meaningful cultural exchange, hospitality-induced euphoria, and the opportunity to build relationships around the world. And the worst: loneliness, exhaustion, estrangement from family and friends, struggles with disordered eating, and unsteady access to medical care. So the question isn’t, “How was tour?” It’s, “What do you eat on tour?” Like the best songs or meals, these conversations and essays evoke something central about the human experience. They show us all the ways that music and food bring us together, break us down, lift us up, and add color to our lives. NOTABLE AUTHORS: With over twenty years of experience in the music industry, Alex Bleeker and Luke Pyenson are your perfect guides into the world of touring. Having toured with their own bands—Real Estate and Frankie Cosmos, respectively—they're asking all the right questions, shedding light and understanding on the lives of touring musicians and the people feeding them. FOOD ANTHOLOGY & MUSIC SCENE DEEP CUT: With interviews and essays from about forty different musicians, chefs, and promoters—ranging from Chris Frantz from Talking Heads to boygenius’s private chef Lily Chait—not only is this book a treasure trove of knowledge and insider information, it also offers something for foodies and music enthusiasts alike. ARMCHAIR TRAVEL: Go behind the curtain all around the world, from America to Russia, Japan to Italy, and dozens of places in between. Read about your favorite musicians’ experiences abroad, all from the comfort of your home.

39,Chinese Espresso,Contested Race and Convivial Space in Contemporary Italy,38,,,Princeton University Press,2024,"Why and how local coffee bars in Italy—those distinctively Italian social and cultural spaces—have been increasingly managed by Chinese baristas since the Great Recession of 2008 Italians regard espresso as a quintessentially Italian cultural product—so much so that Italy has applied to add Italian espresso to UNESCO’s official list of intangible heritages of humanity. The coffee bar is a cornerstone of Italian urban life, with city residents sipping espresso at more than 100,000 of these local businesses throughout the country. And yet, despite its nationalist bona fides, espresso in Italy is increasingly prepared by Chinese baristas in Chinese-managed coffee bars. In this book, Grazia Ting Deng explores the paradox of “Chinese espresso”—the fact that this most distinctive Italian social and cultural tradition is being preserved by Chinese immigrants and their racially diverse clientele. Deng investigates the conditions, mechanisms, and implications of the rapid spread of Chinese-owned coffee bars in Italy since the Great Recession of 2008. Drawing on her extensive ethnographic research in Bologna, Deng describes an immigrant group that relies on reciprocal and flexible family labor to make coffee, deploying local knowledge gleaned from longtime residents who have come, sometimes resentfully, to regard this arrangement as a new normal. The existence of Chinese espresso represents new features of postmodern and postcolonial urban life in a pluralistic society where immigrants assume traditional roles even as they are regarded as racial others. The story of Chinese baristas and their patrons, Deng argues, transcends the dominant Eurocentric narrative of immigrant-host relations, complicating our understanding of cultural dynamics and racial formation within the shifting demographic realities of the Global North.",288,Social Science,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nq_jEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nq_jEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=Nq_jEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Cooking&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nq_jEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nq_jEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Nq_jEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,44

41,10 to 25,The Science of Motivating Young People,40,,,Random House,2024,"Acclaimed developmental psychologist David Yeager reveals the new science of motivating young people in this groundbreaking book. It is a must-read for parents, educators and mentors. ___________________________________ ‘Required reading for anyone who aspires to be a wise influence on the young people they care about.’ Angela Duckworth ‘One of the most fascinating and important books of the past decade . . . It will change millions of lives.’ Carol Dweck ‘This book is life-changing . . . a must-read for anyone who works with young people.’ Laurie Santos, Professor of Psychology at Yale University and host of The Happiness Lab podcast 'An important and extremely useful book.' Andrew Huberman __________________________________________ In 10 to 25, David Yeager explains the emerging science of adolescent and young adult brains to reveal how we can engage, teach and support the young people in our lives. Neuroscientists have discovered that around age ten, changes in the brain spur young people to crave socially rewarding experiences, such as pride, admiration, and respect, and to become highly averse to social pain. This sensitivity to status and respect continues into the mid-twenties. 10 to 25 helps adults to use this science to learn how to encourage young people and avoid frustrating patterns of miscommunication and conflict. Yeager explains how to adopt the mentor mindset – a leadership style that’s attuned to young people’s need for status and respect – by following a few highly effective and easy-to-learn practices. These include validating young people’s perspectives (rather than dismissing them), asking them questions (rather than telling them what to do), and holding them to high standards (rather than coddling them). Yeager’s scientific experiments have shown these practices reduce a wide variety of behaviour problems, including mental health issues, unhealthy eating, stress and purposelessness. Young people in this age group are poised to learn, grow, and accomplish incredible things – if only we can tap into the basic neurobiological systems that drive their motivation and behaviour. 10 to 25 offers long-term strategies to help nurture well-adjusted, independent, accomplished young adults, and is necessary reading for all parents, educators and mentors.",343,Self-Help,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nokIEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nokIEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=nokIEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nokIEQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nokIEQAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=nokIEQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,38
42,Inheritance,The Evolutionary Origins of the Modern World,41,,,Random House,2024,"‘Insightful and breathtaking.’ Yuval Noah Harari, author of Sapiens ‘Bold and sweeping.’ Peter Frankopan, author of The Silk Roads ‘Profoundly thought-provoking.’ Kate Raworth, author of Doughnut Economics How our evolved psychology has shaped the past, present and future of humanity. Each of us is endowed with an inheritance. A set of ancient biases, forged through countless millennia of natural and cultural selection, which shape every facet of our behaviour. For generations, this inheritance has taken us to ever greater heights, driving the rise of more sophisticated technologies, more organized religions, more expansive empires. But now, for the first time, it is failing us. We find ourselves careering towards a future of unprecedented political polarization, deadlier wars, and environmental destruction. In Inheritance, renowned anthropologist Harvey Whitehouse offers a sweeping account of how our evolved biases have shaped humanity’s past and imperil its future. Unveiling a pioneering new way of viewing our collective history – one that weaves together psychological experiments, on-the-ground fieldwork, and big data – Whitehouse introduces three biases that shape human behaviour everywhere: conformism, religiosity, and tribalism. These biases have catalysed the greatest transformations in human history, from the birth of agriculture and arrival of the first kings to the rise and fall of human sacrifice and creation of multiethnic empires. Yet today, they are driving us to ruin. Taking us deep into New Guinea tribes, Libyan militias, and predatory ad agencies, Whitehouse shows how the tools we once used to manage our biases are breaking down, with devastating implications for us all. By uncovering how human nature has shaped our collective history, Inheritance reveals a surprising new path to solving our most urgent problems. The result is a powerful reappraisal of the human journey; one that transforms our understanding of who we are, and who we could be. __ ‘A profoundly important book, of breathtaking scope . . . Full of deep insights into human nature, this is a work of compelling conviction by a master in the field.’ Lewis Dartnell, author of Origins ‘If you spend a lot of time thinking the world seems to have gone mad, bad and dangerous, this thoughtful and thought-provoking book won't just help you work out why that might be – it will also help you see a better path forward.’ Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Channel 4 News presenter ‘A very powerful, provocative and inspiring analysis of the human condition . . . Compelling and highly readable, this book shows why anthropology matters.’ Gillian Tett, Financial Times columnist and Provost of King's College, Cambridge ‘Remarkably readable . . .

Read it!” –Elizabeth Kolbert, author of Under a White Sky and The Sixth Extinction “A brilliant must-read. This book shook and changed me.” –David George Haskell, author of Sounds Wild and Broken, The Songs of Trees, and The Forest Unseen Award-winning Atlantic staff writer Zoë Schlanger delivers a groundbreaking work of popular science that probes the hidden world of the plant kingdom and reveals the astonishing capabilities of the green life all around us. It takes tremendous biological creativity to be a plant. To survive and thrive while rooted in a single spot, plants have adapted ingenious methods of survival. In recent years, scientists have learned about their ability to communicate, recognize their kin and behave socially, hear sounds, morph their bodies to blend into their surroundings, store useful memories that inform their life cycle, and trick animals into behaving to their benefit, to name just a few remarkable talents. The Light Eaters is a deep immersion into the drama of green life and the complexity of this wild and awe-inspiring world that challenges our very understanding of agency, consciousness, and intelligence. In looking closely, we see that plants, rather than imitate human intelligence, have perhaps formed a parallel system. What is intelligent life if not a vine that grows leaves to blend into the shrub on which it climbs, a flower that shapes its bloom to fit exactly the beak of its pollinator, a pea seedling that can hear water flowing and make its way toward it? Zoë Schlanger takes us across the globe, digging into her own memories and into the soil with the scientists who have spent their waking days studying these amazing entities up close. What can we learn about life on Earth from the living things that thrive, adapt, consume, and accommodate simultaneously? More important, what do we owe these life forms once we come to understand their rich and varied abilities? Examining the latest epiphanies in botanical research, Schlanger spotlights the intellectual struggles among the researchers conceiving a wholly new view of their subject, offering a glimpse of a field in turmoil as plant scientists debate the tenets of ongoing discoveries and how they influence our understanding of what a plant is. We need plants to survive. But what do they need us for—if at all? An eye-opening and informative look at the ecosystem we live in, this book challenges us to rethink the role of plants—and our own place—in the natural world.",393,Science,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tvTQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tvTQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=tvTQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tvTQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tvTQEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tvTQEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,39

46,The Link Between Amanita muscaria and Marijuana,,,,,Carl E. Miller,2024,"Amanita muscaria mushrooms have a very long history of psychedelic use, but as of recently they've been referred to as the “Delta-8 of magic mushrooms”. Now, this is rather ironic, at least to me. I say this, because Amanita muscaria mushrooms actually have an odd interaction with marijunana cannabinoids, besides the legality aspect. To be more specific, the interaction that I'm talking about is between muscimol (the main psychoactive compound in Amanita muscaria mushrooms) and cannabinoids from marijuana plants. Now, some of you may have come to this conclusion already, and rightfully so. This has been documented in studies dating back to at least the 1980s. But for some reason or another, these studies have been largely buried. Apparently those who didn't miss the memo, were the manufacturers making the Amanita muscaria + cannabinoid gummies. Maybe you're one of the unlucky ones who only tried Amanita muscaria by itself, and was confused to read reports of people experiencing visual hallucinations from their gummy experience. Now, Amanita muscaria mushrooms alone can produce very interesting psychedelic results, namely a trance-like state of mind with altered perception of reality (including very vivid and lucid dreams). But if you want an experience that is more closely related to a true “magic mushroom” trip, then combining muscimol with cannabinoids is the key to this world. I personally view this as one of the top ten psychedelic discoveries of the last few decades, so I was truly shocked to see it rarely discussed publicly. I touched on this topic, briefly, in my first and second small book about these mushrooms. Then a month after my second book was published, an article online was just published also speculating about it. I wish I would've trusted my instinct more initially, but that was back when my suspicions were just a hunch. However, now I have the proof — so no more speculation. We have entered a new psychedelic era, so psychonauts rejoice!",53,Nature,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QQvsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QQvsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=QQvsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=QQvsEAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Science&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Link_Between_Amanita_muscaria_and_Ma.html?hl=&id=QQvsEAAAQBAJ,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QQvsEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,26

I read it through quickly because it was so interesting, then turned around and read much of it again.”—Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics and bestselling author of Thinking Fast & Slow “I've been recommending A Brief History of Intelligence to everyone I know. A truly novel, beautifully crafted thesis on what intelligence is and how it has developed since the dawn of life itself.""—Angela Duckworth, bestselling author of Grit Equal parts Sapiens, Behave, and Superintelligence, but wholly original in scope, A Brief History of Intelligence offers a paradigm shift for how we understand neuroscience and AI. Artificial intelligence entrepreneur Max Bennett chronicles the five “breakthroughs” in the evolution of human intelligence and reveals what brains of the past can tell us about the AI of tomorrow. In the last decade, capabilities of artificial intelligence that had long been the realm of science fiction have, for the first time, become our reality. AI is now able to produce original art, identify tumors in pictures, and even steer our cars. And yet, large gaps remain in what modern AI systems can achieve—indeed, human brains still easily perform intellectual feats that we can’t replicate in AI systems. How is it possible that AI can beat a grandmaster at chess but can’t effectively load a dishwasher? As AI entrepreneur Max Bennett compellingly argues, finding the answer requires diving into the billion-year history of how the human brain evolved; a history filled with countless half-starts, calamities, and clever innovations. Not only do our brains have a story to tell—the future of AI may depend on it. Now, in A Brief History of Intelligence, Bennett bridges the gap between neuroscience and AI to tell the brain’s evolutionary story, revealing how understanding that story can help shape the next generation of AI breakthroughs. Deploying a fresh perspective and working with the support of many top minds in neuroscience, Bennett consolidates this immense history into an approachable new framework, identifying the “Five Breakthroughs” that mark the brain’s most important evolutionary leaps forward. Each breakthrough brings new insight into the biggest mysteries of human intelligence. Containing fascinating corollaries to developments in AI, A Brief History of Intelligence shows where current AI systems have matched or surpassed our brains, as well as where AI systems still fall short. Simply put, until AI systems successfully replicate each part of our brain’s long journey, AI systems will fail to exhibit human-like intelligence. Endorsed and lauded by many of the top neuroscientists in the field today, Bennett’s work synthesizes the most relevant scientific knowledge and cutting-edge research into an easy-to-understand and riveting evolutionary story. With sweeping scope and stunning insights, A Brief History of Intelligence proves that understanding the arc of our brain’s history can unlock the tools for successfully navigating our technological future.",563,Science,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tymCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tymCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=tymCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tymCEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tymCEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tymCEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,47

Joanna Pocock, Spectator A radical new examination of the transition into motherhood and how it affects the mind, brain and body During pregnancy, childbirth, and early motherhood, women undergo a far-reaching physiological, psychological and social metamorphosis. There is no other time in a human's life course that entails such dramatic change-other than adolescence. And yet this life-altering transition has been sorely neglected by science, medicine and philosophy. Its seismic effects go largely unrepresented across literature and the arts. Speaking about motherhood as anything other than a pastel-hued dream remains, for the most part, taboo. In this ground-breaking, deeply personal investigation, acclaimed journalist and author Lucy Jones brings to light the emerging concept of 'matrescence'. Drawing on new research across various fields - neuroscience and evolutionary biology; psychoanalysis and existential therapy; sociology, economics and ecology - Jones shows how the changes in the maternal mind, brain and body are far more profound, wild and enduring than we have been led to believe. She reveals the dangerous consequences of our neglect of the maternal experience and interrogates the patriarchal and capitalist systems that have created the untenable situation mothers face today. Here is an urgent examination of the modern institution of motherhood, which seeks to unshackle all parents from oppressive social norms.

Levitt, New York Times bestselling author of Freakonomics AN ECONOMIST AND BLOOMBERG BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR Wouldn’t you like to live longer? And better? In this operating manual for longevity, Dr. Peter Attia draws on the latest science to deliver innovative nutritional interventions, techniques for optimizing exercise and sleep, and tools for addressing emotional and mental health. For all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and type 2 diabetes. Too often, it intervenes with treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of healthspan, or quality of life. Dr. Attia believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity, one where we take action now, rather than waiting. This is not “biohacking,” it’s science: a well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Dr. Attia’s aim is less to tell you what to do and more to help you learn how to think about long-term health, in order to create the best plan for you as an individual. In Outlive, readers will discover: • Why the cholesterol test at your annual physical doesn’t tell you enough about your actual risk of dying from a heart attack. • That you may already suffer from an extremely common yet underdiagnosed liver condition that could be a precursor to the chronic diseases of aging. • Why exercise is the most potent pro-longevity “drug”—and how to begin training for the “Centenarian Decathlon.” • Why you should forget about diets, and focus instead on nutritional biochemistry, using technology and data to personalize your eating pattern. • Why striving for physical health and longevity, but ignoring emotional health, could be the ultimate curse of all. Aging and longevity are far more malleable than we think; our fate is not set in stone. With the right roadmap, you can plot a different path for your life, one that lets you outlive your genes to make each decade better than the one before.",425,Health & Fitness,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CspvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CspvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=CspvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CspvEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CspvEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CspvEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,22

55,The Great Displacement,Climate Change and the Next American Migration,54,,,Simon and Schuster,2023,"Shortlisted for the 2024 Carnegie Medal for Excellence “The Great Displacement is closely observed, compassionate, and far-sighted.” —Elizabeth Kolbert, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Under a White Sky The untold story of climate migration in the United States—the personal stories of those experiencing displacement, the portraits of communities being torn apart by disaster, and the implications for all of us as we confront a changing future. Even as climate change dominates the headlines, many of us still think about it in the future tense—we imagine that as global warming gets worse over the coming decades, millions of people will scatter around the world fleeing famine and rising seas. What we often don’t realize is that the consequences of climate change are already visible, right here in the United States. In communities across the country, climate disasters are pushing thousands of people away from their homes. A human-centered narrative with national scope, The Great Displacement is “a vivid tour of the new human geography just coming into view” (David Wallace-Wells, New York Times bestselling author of The Uninhabitable Earth). From half-drowned Louisiana to fire-scorched California, from the dried-up cotton fields of Arizona to the soaked watersheds of inland North Carolina, people are moving. In the last few decades, the federal government has moved tens of thousands of families away from flood zones, and tens of thousands more have moved of their own accord in the aftermath of natural disasters. Insurance and mortgage markets are already shifting to reflect mounting climate risk, pricing people out of risky areas. Over the next fifty years, millions of Americans will be caught up in this churn of displacement, forced inland and northward in what will be the largest migration in our country’s history. The Great Displacement compassionately tells the stories of those who are already experiencing life on the move, while detailing just how radically climate change will transform our lives—erasing historic towns and villages, pushing people toward new areas, and reshaping the geography of the United States.",225,Science,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RBdJEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RBdJEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=RBdJEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RBdJEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RBdJEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RBdJEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,43

The Digital Revolution aims to tell a story, one of the most powerful ideologies of recent decades: that digitalization constitutes a revolution, a break with the past, a radical change for the human beings who are living through it. The book aims to investigate the origins of this idea, how it evolved, which other past revolutions consciously or unconsciously inspired it, which great stories it has conveyed over time, which of its key elements have changed and which ones have persisted and have been repeated in different historical periods. All these discussions, large or small, have settled and condensed into a series of media, advertising, corporate, political, and technical sources.

With Depth Effects, she traces A.I.-enabled techniques of computational imaging back to spatial strategies of early photography, analyzing everyday smartphone apps by way of almost-forgotten media forms. Drawing on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Belisle explores depth both as a problem of visual representation (how can flat images depict a voluminous world?) and as a philosophical paradox (how do things cohere beyond the limits of our view?). She explains how today's depth effects continue colonialist ambitions toward totalizing ways of seeing.

60,Microhistories of Technology,Making the World,59,,,Springer Nature,2023,"In this open access book, Mikael Hård tells a story of how people around the world challenged the production techniques and products brought by globalization. Retaining their autonomy and freedom, creative individuals selectively adopted or rejected modern gadgets, tools, and machines. In standard historical narratives, globalization is portrayed as an unstoppable force that flattens all obstacles in its path. Modern technology is also seen as inexorable: in the nineteenth century, steamships, telegraph lines, and Gatling guns are said to have paved the way for colonialism and other forms of dominating people and societies. Later, shipping containers and computer networks purportedly pulled the planet deeper into a maelstrom of capitalism. Hård discusses instances that push back against these narratives. For example, in Soviet times, inhabitants of Samarkand, Uzbekistan, preferred to remain in—and expand—their own mud-brick houses rather than move into prefabricated, concrete residential buildings. Similarly, nineteenth-century Sumatran carpenters ignored the saws brought to them by missionaries—and chose to chop down trees with their arch-bladed adzes. And people in colonial India successfully competed with capitalist-run Caribbean sugar plantations, continuing to produce their own muscovado and sell it to local consumers. This book invites readers to view the history of technology and material culture through the lens of diversity. Based on research funded by the European Research Council and conducted in the Global South, Microhistories of Technology: Making the World shows that the spread of modern technologies did not erase artisanal production methods and traditional tools.",300,History,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X16vEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X16vEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=X16vEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Technology&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X16vEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X16vEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=X16vEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,20

62,Thinking with Sound,A New Program in the Sciences and Humanities Around 1900,61,,,University of Chicago Press,2023,"Thinking with Sound traces the formation of auditory knowledge in the sciences and humanities in the decades around 1900. When the outside world is silent, all sorts of sounds often come to mind: inner voices, snippets of past conversations, imaginary debates, beloved and unloved melodies. What should we make of such sonic companions? Thinking with Sound investigates a period when these and other newly perceived aural phenomena prompted a far-reaching debate. Through case studies from Paris, Vienna, and Berlin, Viktoria Tkaczyk shows that the identification of the auditory cortex in late nineteenth-century neuroanatomy affected numerous academic disciplines across the sciences and humanities. “Thinking with sound” allowed scholars and scientists to bridge the gaps between theoretical and practical knowledge, and between academia and the social, aesthetic, and industrial domains. As new recording technologies prompted new scientific questions, new auditory knowledge found application in industry and the broad aesthetic realm. Through these conjunctions, Thinking with Sound offers a deeper understanding of today’s second “acoustic turn” in science and scholarship.",311,History,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cc6kEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cc6kEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=cc6kEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Technology&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=cc6kEAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Technology&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Thinking_with_Sound.html?hl=&id=cc6kEAAAQBAJ,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cc6kEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,22

These parts of the work are free to read on the Oxford Academic platform and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations. Feminist AI: Critical Perspectives on Algorithms, Data and Intelligent Machines is the first volume to bring together leading feminist thinkers from across the disciplines to explore the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and related data-driven technologies on human society. Recent years have seen both an explosion in AI systems and a corresponding rise in important critical analyses of these technologies. Central to these analyses has been feminist scholarship, which calls upon the AI sector to be accountable for designing and deploying AI in ways that further, rather than undermine, the pursuit of social justice. This book aims to be a touchstone text for AI researchers concerned with the social impact of their systems, as well as theorists, students and educators in the field of gender and technology. It demonstrates the importance of an intersectional understanding of the risks and benefits of AI, approaching feminism as a political project that aims to challenge various interlocking forms of injustice, social inequality and structural relations of power. Feminist AI showcases the vital contributions of feminist scholarship to thinking about AI, data, and intelligent machines as well as laying the groundwork for future feminist scholarship on AI. It brings together scholars from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, from computer science, software engineering, and medical sciences to political theory, anthropology, and literature. It provides an entry point for scholars of AI, science and technology into the diversity of feminist approaches to AI, and creates a rich dialogue between scholars and practitioners of AI to examine the powerful congruences and generative tensions between different feminist approaches to new and emerging technologies. It features original and essential works specially selected to span multiple generations of practitioners and scholars. These contributors are also attuned to conversations at industry-level around the risks and possibilities that frame the drive to adopt AI. This collection reflects the increasingly blurred divide between the academy, industry and corporate research groups and brings interdisciplinary feminist insights together with postcolonial studies, disability theory, and critical race studies to confront ageism, racism, sexism, ableism, and class-based oppressions in AI.",433,Computers,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gLjaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gLjaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=gLjaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Technology&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=gLjaEAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Technology&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Feminist_AI.html?hl=&id=gLjaEAAAQBAJ,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gLjaEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,49
66,The Fall of Roe,,65,120,,Bonnier Zaffre Ltd.,2024,"Women today are more equal than at any other time in American history. The #MeToo movement has transformed American workplaces. Christian power is weakening as the US grows increasingly secular. Democrats currently control Washington. And yet in this moment of growing equality and diminishing religiosity, women have lost one of the cornerstone achievements of liberal politics: the right to access an abortion. It's easy to characterise abortion politics as a familiar, decades-long battle- evangelicals against feminists, Republican states versus Democratic states, grassroots fighting elites. That kind of political thinking misunderstands the current moment. Abortion is, of course, about a right to terminate a pregnancy. But it's also the stage where the United States works through some of its most fundamental cultural and moral debates. In THE FALL OF ROE, two top New York Times journalists, Elizabeth Dias and Lisa Lerer, have written the definitive book on the end of Roe, revealing how the strategic battle over the most contentious topic in politics helps us understand the battle for control over America. THE FALL OF ROE looks at the playbook for how the religious right came to dominate American politics, a strategy that has vaulted anti-abortion activists into central roles in the conservative movement. And unless Democrats shift their strategy, it is those activists who will be the power brokers who determine the future of America. Furthermore, given that these debates and strategies have influence here and throughout the world, THE FALL OF ROE will be essential not only for understanding America but also informing our own future.",458,Social Science,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uAfwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uAfwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=uAfwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uAfwEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uAfwEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uAfwEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,43

Award-winning journalist and CNN correspondent Elle Reeve was not surprised by the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. With years of in-depth research and on-the-ground investigative reporting under her belt, Reeve was aware of the preoccupations of the online far right and their journey from the computer to QAnon, militias, and racist groups. At the same time, Reeve saw a parallel growth of counterforces, with citizen vigilantes using new tools and tactics to take down the far right. This ongoing battle, long fought mainly on the internet, had arrived in the real world with greater and greater frequency. With a sharp eye for detail and a dash of dark humor, Reeve explains the origins of this shocking sweep of political violence. Drawing on countless interviews with sources in the white nationalist movement as well as hundreds of as-yet-unseen documents, she takes us on a surreal journey from the darkest corners of the internet to the most significant and chilling scenes of real-world political violence in generations.

68,Fifteen Cents on the Dollar,How Americans Made the Black-White Wealth Gap,67,121,,HarperCollins,2024,"A sweeping, narrative history of Black wealth and the economic discrimination embedded in America’s financial system. The early 2020s will long be known as a period of racial reflection. In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, Americans of all backgrounds joined together in historic demonstrations in the streets, discussions in the workplace, and conversations at home about the financial gaps that remain between white and Black Americans. This deeply investigated book shows the scores of setbacks that have held the Black-white wealth gap in place—from enslavement to redlining to banking discrimination—and, ultimately, the reversals that occurred in the mid-2020s as the push for racial equity became a polarized political debate. Fifteen Cents on the Dollar follows the lives of four Black Millennial professionals and a banking company founded with the stated mission of closing the Black-white wealth gap. That company, known as Greenwood, a reference to the historic Black Wall Street district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, generated immense excitement and hope among people looking for new ways of business that might lead to greater equity. But the twists and turns of Greenwood’s journey also raise tough questions about what equality really means. Seasoned journalist-academics Louise Story and Ebony Reed present a nuanced portrait of Greenwood’s founders—the entertainment executive Ryan Glover; the Grammy-winning rapper Michael Render, better known as Killer Mike; and the Civil Rights leader and two-term Atlanta mayor, Andrew Young—along with new revelations about their lives, careers, and families going back to the Civil War. Equally engaging are the stories of the lesser-known individuals—a female tech employee from rural North Carolina trying to make it in a big city; a rising leader at the NAACP whose father is in prison; an owner of a BBQ stand in Atlanta fighting to keep his home; and a Black man in a biracial marriage grappling with his roots when his father is shot by the police. In chronicling these staggering injustices, Fifteen Cents on the Dollar shows why so little progress has been made on the wealth gap and provides insights Americans should consider if they want lasting change.",594,History,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lLvXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lLvXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=lLvXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lLvXEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lLvXEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lLvXEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,35

70,Polis,A New History of the Ancient Greek City-State from the Early Iron Age to the End of Antiquity,69,,,Princeton University Press,2024,"""The polis, the dominant political form around which ancient Greeks structured their lives and activities, is perhaps their most fundamental creation and enduring legacy. It was a highly successful form of social organization in which Greek culture thrived, including architecture, literature, and philosophy. In this book, ancient historian John Ma offers a new history of the polis from its origins in the Early Iron Age through its eclipse in Late Antiquity. He aims to answer a few big questions about it-Why did it emerge? What needs did it fulfill? How did it work? In addition, it is often assumed that the polis, along with the concomitant values of democracy and freedom, came to an end with the Classical period. Taking a contrary view, Ma explores how it endured under imperial control (the Persian Achaimenids, the Hellenistic kings, the Roman Empire), as well as why and how it eventually ended. In addressing these questions, Ma examines not only the most well-known ancient city-states like Sparta and Athens but also many lesser-known ones. He shows how complex the relations of power, access, and membership between the city, the territory, and the members of the polis were. Ma also examines the polis's significance as a social form and looks to the people who constitute the polis, from free adult men-stakeholders in institutional power, slaveowners, or heads of households-and elites to women, foreigners, and enslaved peoples, however disempowered. He draws on recent work on gender and slavery to evaluate the place of domination and violence in the polis. In doing so, Ma shows how the composition of the citizen body is both a political and social issue. The powerful combination of central political ideas and conflict around the issues of autonomy and social power led, Ma argues, to a ""great convergence"" of polis forms, producing a relatively uniform, stable organism, centred on communitarian, democratic forms and bargains between the community and its elites. This convergence led to the diffusion and harmonization of polis forms, both within and beyond the Aegean, and which allowed them to endure for almost a thousand years with an even longer legacy""--",736,History,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CC3oEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CC3oEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=CC3oEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=CC3oEAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Polis.html?hl=&id=CC3oEAAAQBAJ,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CC3oEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,47
71,Banaras,A journey into the heart of the city,70,,,Penguin Random House India Private Limited,2024,"There is a time when we are growing but we merely grow and a time when we start understanding how things around us function. Some things make sense and some don’t, and we begin to ask why . . . Suddenly life takes on a meaning and we start searching for more meanings. Over the course of more than three decades, Bela Bhatia’s work and concerns have brought her face-to-face with the harsh nature of people’s lives in India’s ‘forgotten country’—the hamlets, villages and slums—and the oppressive forces that rule and ruin the lives of Dalits, Adivasis, bonded labourers, women and other downtrodden groups. She has also witnessed how their everyday lives are pockmarked with violence and the brutality—often organized—they face when they resist. India’s Forgotten Country captures Bela’s early years as an activist in rural Gujarat, her research on the Naxalite movement, her investigations of violations of democratic rights in different regions, and her recent years dealing with the ongoing conflict between the state and Maoists in Bastar. The essays build on first-hand investigations conducted in states ranging from Bihar and Telangana to Rajasthan and Nagaland, besides Kashmir. People such as Deepa Musahar, Kaliben, Muchaki Sukadi, Zarifa Begum, Tareptsuba and others have ample space in this book to speak for themselves. These essays are stories of life, death and despair, but also serve as inspiring accounts of resistance, resilience, courage and hope.",683,History,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ic4KEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ic4KEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=ic4KEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=ic4KEQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Banaras.html?hl=&id=ic4KEQAAQBAJ,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ic4KEQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,32
72,There Was Nothing You Could Do,Bruce Springsteen's “Born In The U.S.A.” and the End of the Heartland,71,,,Hachette UK,2024,"A thought-provoking exploration of Bruce Springsteen’s iconic album, Born in the U.S.A.—a record that both chronicled and foreshadowed the changing tides of modern America On June 4, 1984, Columbia Records issued what would become one of the best-selling and most impactful rock albums of all time. An instant classic, Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the U.S.A. would prove itself to be a landmark not only for the man who made it, but rock music in general and even the larger American culture over the next 40 years. In There Was Nothing You Could Do, veteran rock critic Steven Hyden shows exactly how this record became such a pivotal part of the American tapestry. Alternating between insightful criticism, meticulous journalism, and personal anecdotes, Hyden delves into the songs that made—and didn’t make—the final cut, including the tracks that wound up on its sister album, 1982’s Nebraska. He also investigates the myriad reasons why Springsteen ran from and then embraced the success of his most popular (and most misunderstood) LP, as he carefully toed the line between balancing his commercial ambitions and being co-opted by the machine. But the book doesn’t stop there. Beyond Springsteen’s own career, Hyden explores the role the album played in a greater historical context, documenting not just where the country was in the tumultuous aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, but offering a dream of what it might become—and a perceptive forecast of what it turned into decades later. As Springsteen himself reluctantly conceded, many of the working-class middle American progressives Springsteen wrote about in 1984 had turned into resentful and scorned Trump voters by the 2010s. And though it wasn’t the future he dreamed of, the cautionary warnings tucked within Springsteen’s heartfelt lyrics prove that the chaotic turmoil of our current moment has been a long time coming. How did we lose Springsteen’s heartland? And what can listening to this prescient album teach us about the decline of our country? In There Was Nothing You Could Do, Hyden takes readers on a journey to find out.",241,Music,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jYjaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jYjaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=jYjaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jYjaEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jYjaEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jYjaEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,28
73,Fat Leonard,"How One Man Bribed, Bilked, and Seduced the U.S. Navy",72,,,Simon and Schuster,2024,"#1 New York Times bestselling author Craig Whitlock’s masterful account of one of the biggest public corruption scandals in American history—exposing how a charismatic Malaysian defense contractor bribed scores of high-ranking military officers, defrauded the US Navy of tens of millions of dollars, and jeopardized our nation’s security. All the admirals in the US Navy knew Leonard Glenn Francis—either personally or by his legendary reputation. He was the larger-than-life defense contractor who greeted them on the pier whenever they visited ports in Asia, ready to show them a good time after weeks at sea while his company resupplied their ships and submarines. He was famed throughout the fleet for the gluttonous parties he hosted for officers: $1,000-per-person dinners at Asia’s swankiest restaurants, featuring unlimited Dom Pérignon, Cuban cigars, and sexy young women. On the surface, with his flawless American accent, he seemed like a true friend of the Navy. What the brass didn’t realize, until far too late, was that Francis had seduced them by exploiting their entitlement and hubris. While he was bribing them with gifts, lavish meals, and booze-fueled orgies, he was making himself obscenely wealthy by bilking American taxpayers. Worse, he was stealing military secrets from under the admirals’ noses and compromising national security. Based on reams of confidential documents—including the blackmail files that Francis kept on Navy officers—Fat Leonard is the full, unvarnished story of a world-class con man and a captivating testament to the corrosive influence of greed within the ranks of the American military.",480,Biography & Autobiography,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xI4CEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xI4CEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=xI4CEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=xI4CEQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Fat_Leonard.html?hl=&id=xI4CEQAAQBAJ,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xI4CEQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,35

79,Medieval Romance and Material Culture,,78,,,Boydell & Brewer Ltd,2015,"Studies of how the physical manifests itself in medieval romance - and medieval romances as objects themselves. Medieval romance narratives glitter with the material objects that were valued and exchanged in late-medieval society: lovers' rings and warriors' swords, holy relics and desirable or corrupted bodies. Romance, however, is also agenre in which such objects make meaning on numerous levels, and not always in predictable ways. These new essays examine from diverse perspectives how romances respond to material culture, but also show how romance as a genre helps to constitute and transmit that culture. Focusing on romances circulating in Britain and Ireland between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries, individual chapters address such questions as the relationship between objects and protagonists in romance narrative; the materiality of male and female bodies; the interaction between visual and verbal representations of romance; poetic form and manuscript textuality; and how a nineteenth-century edition of medieval romances provoked artists to homage and satire.

Box, #1 New York Times bestselling author), a deadly plot against the president’s life emerges from the shadows of the Deep State. Recently elected President Richard Monroe—populist, controversial, and divisive—is at the center of an increasingly polarized Washington, DC.

In the midst of contentious political turf wars, the White House chief of staff is found dead in his house and West Wing intern and ex-Army grunt Hayley Chill is positive that it’s not from natural causes. Determined to find the truth, Hayley uncovers shocking evidence that a wide-ranging conspiracy is running beneath the surface of DC in an effort to undermine the rule of law—and democracy itself. Soon, Hayley is in a race against time to reveal the truth and save the life of the next victim: the president. “Deep State rings eerily true [and] will keep you turning pages well into the night” (Jack Carr, former Navy SEAL and author of The Terminal List).",304,Fiction,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=peWtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=peWtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=peWtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Mystery&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=peWtEAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Deep_State.html?hl=&id=peWtEAAAQBAJ,TRUE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=peWtEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,36

So asserts Daniel Jütte in this engrossing, vivid, and award-winning work. He maintains that the widespread acceptance and even reverence for this “economy of secrets” in premodern Europe created a highly complex and sometimes perilous space for mutual contact between Jews and Christians. Surveying the interactions between the two religious groups in a wide array of secret sciences and practices, the author relates true stories of colorful “professors of secrets” and clandestine encounters. In the process Jütte examines how our current notion of secrecy is radically different in this era of WikiLeaks, Snowden, etc., as opposed to centuries earlier when the truest, most important knowledge was generally considered to be secret by definition.",444,Religion,0,0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YfXzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YfXzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=YfXzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Mystery&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=YfXzCAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Age_of_Secrecy.html?hl=&id=YfXzCAAAQBAJ,FALSE,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YfXzCAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api,26

Tommy believes the Catholic Church has no basis under United States law to exclude women from the seminary and files suit against the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston and Archbishop Jorge Sierra for sex discrimination without justifiable cause. The Catholic Church hires Monsignor Enrico Renzulli, the General Counsel of the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops. Renzulli, a priest and Harvard-educated attorney, has substantial trial experience and has taken on and beaten lawyers considerably smarter than O'Reilly. He believes the lawsuit should be summarily dismissed because the First Amendment of the United States Constitution grants all citizens the freedom of religion, and it prevents a federal court from interfering with the ecclesiastical rules of any church, including the Catholic Church. But watching and waiting in the wings is an extreme and tyrannical sect unaffiliated with the Catholic Church. As the trial unfolds and the legal proceedings begin to undermine the sacred Catholic Church teaching, a right-wing extremist and a member of the Holy Mother Church concocts a plot to stop the heresy against God that includes kidnapping and murder. Will the First Amendment protect the Catholic Church and supersede all? Will Tommy O'Reilly come through? Will Aleksandra Kowalski survive this ordeal? Find out in R.A.
